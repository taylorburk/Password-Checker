# Password-Checker
This project can securely check if your password has been 'pwned' or hacked, without transmitting your password through the internet. It uses the 'HaveIBeenPwned' API to get the passwords that may have been leaked, using the SHA1 hash generator.
This website uses a technique called K-anonymity, which is a modern technique, that allows your password to stay private.
